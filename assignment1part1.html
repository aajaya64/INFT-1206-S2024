<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
Dear Eileen,<br> <br>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's 
science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions 
one by one, in the following sections.

<h2>Starting dates</h2>

We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, 
however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; 
the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>

Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
